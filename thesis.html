    <h1>Thesis: Human-Robot Collaboration in Assembly Tasks</h1>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This research investigates how teleoperated robotic systems influence human performance and communication during physical collaboration. By comparing two-person human teams to human-robot teams on a wire assembly task, we evaluated differences in task completion time, workload (NASA-TLX), and communication patterns using Bales IPA.</p>
    <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To evaluate the impact of robotic assistance on team task performance, workload, and communication dynamics.</p>
    <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Data collection involved subjective measures like NASA-TLX and SART, objective task data, and IPA coding from video transcripts. Collaboration mode (HH vs TRH), task difficulty, and cognitive load were key factors.</p>
    <p><strong>Results:</strong> Robotic assistance reduced perceived workload and improved task fluency in certain conditions. Communication dynamics were more structured and efficient in human-robot teams than human-human pairs.</p>
