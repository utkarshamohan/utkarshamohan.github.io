    <h1>Utkarsha Mohan</h1>
    <p>I’m a UX researcher and human factors engineer with a background in mechanical engineering and product strategy. Right now, I’m finishing my master’s at Virginia Tech, where I study how robotic systems change the way people work, think, and communicate.</p>
    <p>Before grad school, I led research for UMANG, India’s national e-governance chatbot, and ran eye-tracking and behavior studies at Viacom18’s Voot streaming app. Whether it’s public tech or physical systems, I focus on making experiences feel more intuitive, accessible, and grounded in real human behavior.</p>
    <p>I'm looking for opportunities where I can apply research to build better tools—ones that meet people where they are and help them do more with less friction.</p>
