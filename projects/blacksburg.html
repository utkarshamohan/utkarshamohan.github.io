      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This project involved a detailed cognitive systems engineering study of the Blacksburg Transit systemâ€”a complex, real-world public transportation network serving thousands of riders daily. Our goal was to apply Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) to better understand how planners, dispatchers, drivers, and support staff interact with this system, especially under dynamic constraints such as traffic delays, breakdowns, or inclement weather.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than focusing solely on usability or interface design, this analysis emphasized the sociotechnical structureâ€”how information, roles, and goals are distributed across agents and environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        We examined the system across several layers: physical resources (buses, routes), abstract functions (scheduling, demand estimation), decision tasks (e.g., rerouting during breakdowns), and broader social constraints (budgeting, policy). I contributed to every phase, from data collection via interviews and system documentation to constructing abstraction hierarchies, decision ladders, and strategies analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        By unpacking how different roles interact with each layer of the system, we identified several opportunities to better support decision-making, particularly for drivers and dispatchers.

      <h3>Aim</h3>
      <p>
        To map out decision-making processes and system constraints in the Blacksburg Transit network and provide recommendations to reduce inefficiencies and improve responsiveness during disruptions.

      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Work Domain Analysis (abstraction hierarchy of resources, functions, values)</li>
        <li>Control Task Analysis (decision ladder models of key operator tasks)</li>
        <li>Strategies Analysis (comparison of actual vs. ideal operator responses)</li>
        <li>Interviews with stakeholders (planners, drivers)</li>
        <li>Artifact analysis of route maps, internal documents, and operating procedures</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        Our analysis revealed a consistent mismatch between real-time demands (e.g., breakdown rerouting) and the tools available to drivers and dispatchers. Schedules were too rigid, and communication channels did not support flexible strategy adaptation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We proposed a set of interventions, including a decision-support tool for rerouting, improved visual displays for time-sensitive data, and a training module for response under uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The findings demonstrated the power of CWA in identifying breakdowns not just in user interfaces, but in organizational logic and workflow structure. Our recommendations could translate to higher reliability and reduced stress for frontline transit staff.
