      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This project was part of a graduate-level course on usability engineering, conducted in collaboration with Virginia Tech‚Äôs Hokie Wellness and the Digital Wellbeing Lab. The Digital Wellbeing initiative, though rich in intent and content, suffered from low student participation‚Äîparticularly in weekly challenges and lab-based interventions meant to foster healthier digital habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team was tasked with identifying barriers in student engagement and developing actionable design solutions that would make these services more visible, accessible, and appealing to the student population.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role spanned early research and conceptual modeling to prototyping and user testing. We found that while students were interested in digital wellbeing, they were often unaware of the available resources or found the registration process too cumbersome. Multiple QR codes across posters led to confusion, and the decentralized access points (Linktree, Hokie Wellness website, etc.) diluted user intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through interviews, contextual inquiry, and affinity diagramming, we captured users' mental models and pain points. From there, we designed a unified, low-friction system using storyboards and a high-fidelity Figma prototype.

      <h3>Aim</h3>
      <p>
        To increase student participation in Virginia Tech‚Äôs Digital Wellbeing Lab activities by improving the information architecture, registration process, and user-facing design.

      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stakeholder interviews (Hokie Wellness staff, student users)</li>
        <li>Affinity diagram and Work Domain Analysis</li>
        <li>Conceptual model and ecological perspective mapping</li>
        <li>Storyboarding and scenario-based design</li>
        <li>Wireframing and prototyping using Figma</li>
        <li>Empirical evaluation using benchmark tasks and critical incident reflection</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        Our redesigned system consolidated scattered entry points into a single QR code and simplified the signup process through Single Sign-On and auto-populated fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new design also introduced a homepage with current and past challenges, reminders, and visual clarity tied to Virginia Tech‚Äôs brand identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feedback from empirical evaluation showed significantly improved task success in finding and submitting challenges. The final prototype not only addressed the practical friction points but also reshaped how students perceived the Digital Wellbeing Lab‚Äîfrom an abstract resource to a tangible, approachable campus support system.
