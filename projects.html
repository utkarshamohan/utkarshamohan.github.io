        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This study investigates how teleoperated robotic systems influence human performance and communication during physical collaboration. By comparing two-person human teams to human-robot teams on a wire assembly task, we evaluated differences in task completion time, workload (NASA-TLX), and communication patterns using Bales IPA. Our goal was to understand how robotic mediation impacts coordination, task fluency, and perceived effort.</p>
